This is the first time that this classic of 20th century Buddhist scholarship has been made available in a true digital edition. We are able to do this because the <a href='http://www.palitext.com/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Pali Text Society</a>, holders of the copyright, kindly released the text under a <a href='http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/' rel='noopener' target='_blank'>Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0</a> licence.",

On SuttaCentral, therefore, we have only the translated text itself. However, in this case we felt that the scholarly apparatus was valuable enough to put the considerable effort into creating a proper digital edition of the entire text. This is what we offer in these downloads. These are, of course, covered by the same Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 licence. The text is presented in a number of formats, which are explained below.",
