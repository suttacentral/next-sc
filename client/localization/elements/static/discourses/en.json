This collection contains the teachings of the Buddha and his disciples, as collected and transmitted by the schools of early Buddhism. This is the well-spring of Dhamma, from which the teachings and practices of the many schools of Buddhism are drawn.",

        "980bdf75bd197f5bad82e291b697db86": "The Buddha lived around the 5th century BCE, and lived and taught in the nations of the Ganges plain in northern India, especially the regions known today as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. He had a long career, and was said to have taught for forty-five years. The canonical Vinaya texts relate how, after his passing towards the end of the 5th century BCE, the Buddha’s followers, led by his closest disciple, Ānanda, collected his teachings at the great First Council in Rājagaha (modern Rajgir), ensuring their survival until today.",

        "9517a63ebb91e247ffcefbe69b71db41": "The texts would have originally been in a Prākrit, that is, a dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan closely related to Sanskrit. The exact form of Prākrit is unknown, and indeed it may not have been entirely standardized, since monastics from the earliest times were using different dialects. Indications in the Pali texts suggest that they were derived from an earlier version in Māgadhī, that is, the language of the kingdom of Magadha. It appears that they were standardized in later centuries to a dialect similar to that used widely across central India for inscriptions, with a partial Sanskritization. Nevertheless, these languages differ mostly in phonology, and apart from a few edge cases, changes from one form to another do not affect the meaning.",
        "eb2d9ac048f63b514bd26677c6142d1f": "Transmission",
        "f08e2f3c017f67c2ee5dbea504848994": "For many years, the texts were passed down in an oral form. This was organized with groups of reciters, all reciting together the same text to ensure accuracy. We are often skeptical that an oral tradition can maintain texts accurately for a long time. This is our cultural bias, since all we’ve known are written texts. But oral transmission was normal in ancient India. The brahmanical Ṛg Veda, for example, was passed down in letter-perfect form for hundreds, maybe thousands, of years before being written down. No matter what the medium of transmission—oral, written, or digital—corruptions and changes can creep in. The most important thing in maintaining accuracy is not the medium, but the care and dedication of the people doing the work. The Buddhist texts, through the use of such devices as repetition, are highly optimized for reliable transmission of doctrine.",
        "13fc8d83ace176f304af5fea6bd587b3": "The Sri Lankan historical chronicles record that in 29 BCE, to guard against upheaval in the country, the Pali canon was written down in the Aluvihare Rock Temple. While we don’t have historical records for the mainland, it seems safe to assume that texts there were written down around the same period. Indeed, a range of Buddhist manuscripts from northern regions have been found dating from the early centuries CE, one of which has been carbon dated to around 75 CE.",
        "9e3c3f9c8faae790b3e3ada0f5dae115": "Due to the materials and climate, no such early manuscripts of the Pali canon have survived. There are a few earlier passages in inscriptions and the like, but the bulk of our Pali texts come from manuscripts that have been recopied in the past few centuries.",
        "708e177887291aeb4bb8e301da1e32a5": "The Chinese texts originate from manuscripts of various schools that were taken to China and translated there by teams of monks. Each collection has a different origin, and due to the meticulous records of the Chinese canon, the translators and dates of these are usually well known. Most of the early Buddhist discourses were translated around the 5th century CE, though some were earlier and some later than this. It is not always possible to determine exactly what the original language of the manuscripts was, but in many cases it was probably Sanskrit. However, a variety of other Indic languages such as Gandhārī or Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit may have been used.",
        "d56f1e13ebddf8a04f7316845c1150e0": "Likewise, the early texts found in Tibetan stem from Sanskrit texts that were translated in Tibet over millenium ago.",
        "b619815c5efc73ba63772230d91cb723": "None of the modern forms of Buddhism normally use Sanskrit texts, as the northern schools preserved only the translations. The texts in Sanskrit and other early Indic dialects stem from a range of fortuitous finds in the past century. Certain Sanskrit texts were discovered in ancient manuscripts in Nepal and Tibet, where they had lain mostly untouched since being brought from India nearly a thousand years ago. Several finds have unearthed more texts. Manuscripts from Gilgit and elsewhere in central Asia, Afghanistan, and Pakistan contain suttas in several different languages, ranging from extensive texts to tiny scraps containing only a few letters. Some were recovered from proper archaeological research, but other manuscripts simply appeared on the black market and their origin can only be guessed at. These manuscripts represent the spectrum of Buddhist literature of the time, including early suttas, Vinaya, Abhidhamma, legends, Mahāyāna texts, and commentaries. Here we are only concerned with the early sutta material.",
        "76d653d7021024bcdc49c72349da8fa3": "Such texts are sometimes called the “Dead Sea Scrolls” of Buddhism, but this is misleading. While the Dead Sea Scrolls contained new texts indicating a radically different perspective on early Christianity, these Buddhist suttas are almost always minor variations on what we find in the Pali canon. They serve to indicate the spread and diversity of Buddhism, and offer clarification on many points of history and detail, but they do not radically revise our understanding of the teachings.",

        "f61adc0a9fd7eb9955430e8e1234413a": "The century after the Buddha passed away witnessed a transformation in Indian political history. The 16 nations of the Buddha’s time were amalgamated by the superior force of the Magadhan kingdom, which became an empire encompassing most of the Indian mainland. At the same time, the invasion by Alexander the Great established Greek kingdoms in the north-west, initiating an era of international trade.",
        "3aeca0f400b08ac6a72de75074051757": "The Buddhist community, sponsored by kings such as Aśoka, took full advantage of these favorable conditions to spread the Dhamma over the Indian subcontinent and further. Less than two centuries after the Buddha’s passing, Buddhist communities were thriving in regions as far-flung as Sri Lanka and Afghanistan.",
        "9a14dc4bc16deed0f041a6c86b8ecfdc": "But with this growth came new challenges. The community began to diverge, driven primarily by distance, but also by doctrinal disagreements and personality clashes. Soon there were, according to the traditional reckoning, “eighteen” schools. This is just a conventional number, and there were really four or five major groups of schools, with many regional branches.",
        "3b32c41405baefef17e5fa7d72669575": "Each of these schools would have preserved a scriptural collection. Today we have only a small selection of these. Nevertheless, though much is lost, we do have enough to get a reasonable idea of the similarities and differences. Note that, unlike the Vinaya texts, it is sometimes difficult to determine the school affiliation of a sutta collection.",
        "81ff34bfae36437ed27ebc656b1c5bd6": "For the purposes of the Discourses, the following schools are most important.",

In addition, there is a complete set of commentaries for all the texts. For these reasons, the Pali collection has been, and will continue to be, the primary source for the early Buddhist teachings.",
        "d04cc4ab17a2a5d59026c912407d55b9": "For the rest, we have collections and fragments that were preserved primarily in Chinese translation, and to a lesser extent in Tibetan. The few texts in Sanskrit and other early Indic languages stem from chance finds; thousand year-old manuscripts preserved in mountain monasteries in Tibet or Nepal, or even older texts dug up from the sands of Central Asia. These texts are much less complete than the Pali, have been little studied, and pose a range of difficult linguistic and practical problems. Nevertheless, they have a unique value in offering an alternate source for checking and comparing the Pali texts.",
        "ff834f8b144c97be61a4a4112324dcd2": "The unanimous opinion of the scholars who have studied these texts is that they are mostly consistent in doctrine and content, and differ mainly in arrangement and organization. While it is true that the differences are not small, and it is hard to generalize, it is clear that the early community saw their main task to preserve verbatim the words of the Buddha, especially the essential teachings, a task that they took very seriously.",

They indicate different developments within the Buddhist community in the centuries following the Buddha. These later texts include the extensive collections of Jātaka tales, found in Pali and other traditions. Note that in the Pali tradition, only the verses are canoncial, while the stories themselves are found in the commentary.",

They are considered to be Buddhavacana, the “words of the Buddha”, and are revered as sacred scripture. Each school, of course, accepts other texts as canonical also; but the Discourses, together with the Vinayas, are the main areas of overlap between the schools.",
        "cad649622b00eb8580111fdbb32a1eac": "So while we can say that the early Discourses are in principle considered canonical generally, for practical purposes each of the schools has a specific set of early Discourses found in their own canon.",

        "625cd5185e5dbe5fcbba1b7537ecd48f": "In traditional Buddhist education, the Discourses have usually not been directly taught. Rather, the teachings and principles found in the Discourses have been assimilated and organized in later texts, which became the medium of education. In the Theravāda, Discourses were until recently passed down in Pali, and so were only accessible to those, usually monks, who learned Pali. And not all those who learned Pali would study the Discourses. It seems that teaching was for practical purposes handed down in local monastic traditions, based on handbooks and sets of notes and commentaries. Before modern times, it would have been rare to find any but the largest monasteries that actually possessed a full set of the Tipiṭaka. Today, printed sets of the canon are widely available in both Pali and translation; but they are still often left in a locked cabinet on the shrine, unread.",
        "1e42256acc4786ec4f409115868a3957": "For the most part, Buddhists might be familiar with a small set of popular discourses.

Sri Lankan monks, for example, memorize the Dhammapada. However, this is not the case in Thailand, for example, where there is no education requirement for monks. Even in the nine years of the formal Dhamma study curriculum in Thailand, the canonical Discourses are not studied, as they are considered too sacred.",

Whereas traditional scholarship remained within each school, interpreting them within their local contexts, the new scholarship aimed to locate the texts in historical time and place. This approach was both critical—in the sense of being skeptical of traditional claims to authority, and requiring evidence to support claims—and constructive, in the sense that it aimed to build a coherent and meaningful historical picture in which to understand the texts.",

However, across Asia we find popular reform movements that emphasize the central importance of the suttas. Sutta study is most popular in Sri Lanka, where there is a proliferation of teachers and movements advocating a return to the suttas. The hugely popular monk Venerable Kiribathgoda Gnanananda Thero is controversial for his insistence on treating the suttas as the primary sources of Dhamma. In Thailand, the Buddhavacana movement of Ajahn Kukrit Sotthibalo is changing the face of contemporary Thailand, bringing many people to read the suttas for the first time. In Taiwan, similarly, the recently deceased master Yin Shun emphasized the historical primacy of the early texts, arguing that there was an essential continuity between them and early Mahāyāna. And in countries outside the regions of traditional Buddhism, teachers such as Ajahn Brahm, Bhikkhu Bodhi, and many others advocate the teachings of the suttas.",

These criticisms aim to dislodge the modernist consensus, arguing that we have no real way of knowing what the Buddha taught, or the provenance of the Pali and other texts. A variety of specific arguments attempt to refute key claims of the modernists, such as the idea that the Buddha’s teaching was essentially rational. These arguments have been repeatedly criticized by experts in the field. The postmodern approach has has yet to produce constructive results comparable to those of modernism.",

Under the leadership of T.W. Rhys Davids, the Pali Text Society, founded in 1881, undertook the task of translating the entire canon into English. These translations were groundbreaking, but have for the most part been replaced by a more modern and accurate generation of translations by scholars such as Bhikkhu Bodhi. We include some of the older translations on SuttaCentral, but for the most part they are primarily of historical interest, since not only is the language archaic, but they contain many errors.",
