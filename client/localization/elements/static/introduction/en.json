This is a large collection of teachings attributed to the Buddha or his earliest disciples, who were teaching in India around 2500 years ago. They are regarded as sacred canon in all schools of Buddhism.",
        "9ce4240bf67449653c424dab5519423a": "There are several Buddhist traditions, and each has passed down a set of scriptures from ancient times. SuttaCentral is specially focused on the scriptures of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-sectarian_Buddhism\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wikipedia article on pre-sectarian Buddhism\">earliest period of Buddhism</a>, and hosts texts in over thirty languages.

The teachings cover a wide range of topics, including ethics, meditation, family life, renunciation, the nature of wisdom and true understanding, and the path to peace.",
        "71eea109c3638e4d23850f291af6d625": "The teachings show how to live well so as to be free of suffering. They teach non-violence and compassion, and emphasize the value of the spiritual over the material. Many discourses discuss meditation, while others are concerned with ethics, or with a rational and clear understanding of the world as perceived. They show the Buddha engaging with people from all walks of life and discussing a diverse range of topics. But he said that all of his words have one taste, the taste of freedom.",
        "5861ff63b6621d7716d629b1b5072276": "While there are plenty of summaries and interpretations of his teaching, there’s nothing quite like encountering it in his own words. The early texts depict the Buddha in a vivid and diverse range of contexts, speaking with monastics, ascetics, criminals, kings, businessmen, lepers, prostitutes, paupers, wives, skeptics, friends, and enemies. It’s not just what he says, but the way he deals with this spectrum of humanity, always with kindness, clarity, dignity, and respect.",

We use “parallel” for variant texts that appear to be descended from a common ancestor. Often the texts are so close that this identification is simple. Sometimes, however, there is a less close relationship between two given texts. In such cases we indicate a “resembling parallel”. This doesn’t imply any particular kind of relationship between the resembling parallel and the basic text. It simply suggests that if you are studying the basic text, you might want to look at the resembling parallel, too. For a detailed discussion, see <a href=\"/methodology\" target=\"_blank\">our page on Methodology</a>.",

When does a text stop being a full parallel and start being a resembling parallel? And when does it become merely a text that bears certain similar features? There are no black and white answers to such questions. Rather, making these identifications draws on the accumulated learning and experience of a succession of scholars. Inevitably there will be disagreements in detail; yet in the main, there is a broad consensus as to what constitutes a parallel. Ultimately, the important point is that these identifications help the student to study and learn from related texts in diverse collections.",

The first two—Long and Middle—are organized by length, the Saṁyutta or “Linked” division is organized by topic, and the Aṅguttara or “Numbered” division is organized by numerical sets. These four collections are synoptic; they constitute one largely unified body of text and doctrine, organized mainly for the convenience of the reciters who memorized it.",
        "5a0d06db2d5f1d743ed54f7ab0d1bef7": "The fifth <i>nikāya</i> is a rather different kind of collection. The core of it is a set of early texts that are mostly verse.

Sometimes these sections are crucial for making sense of a text. For example, the <i>saṁyutta</i> is used in the Saṁyutta Nikāya for groups of discourses on the same topic, and the <i>nipāta</i> is used in the Aṅguttara Nikāya for groups of discourses with the same number of items. In the Vinaya, the <i>khandhaka</i> is likewise an essential structural feature. Elsewhere, however, we find structures of less importance, such as the <i>pannāsa</i> or group of fifty discourses. Originally these may have helped organize the texts into manuscripts, but these days they are retained for historical purposes.",

For example, the “Chapter on Kings” of the Middle Discourses contains ten discussions involving kings. In many cases, however, the <i>vagga</i> is merely a structural convention, and is simply named after its first discourse.",
