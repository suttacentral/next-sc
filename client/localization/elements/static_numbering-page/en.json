This problem arises partly because there are simply so many texts, and partly because there are multiple editions of each text. The problem is compounded on SuttaCentral as we incorporate texts from multiple different canonical sources, and these have never before been presented as a combined edition.",
        "9a0e11c038422ab2c2963d3e4177cea4": "We try to use the simplest, most rational and consistent approach for our primary numbering system. This is fine for most people, and it is what we recommend when sharing or citing our texts. But some students will be wanting to look up references from different sources, so for their convenience we supply additional references.",

Subsequent translations are matched with the original segment by segment, although the relation between text and translation for a particular segment need not be exact.",

We will gradually roll them out for additional texts. These are designed to be the basis for a new generation of translations going forward. Note that it is not easy to retrospectively match an old translation to the new segments; it must be done by hand, one segment at a time. So for the foreseeable future we will retain unsegmented texts.",

This text inherits the section numbering from the Pali Text Society Pali edition. This is from the tenth section, numbered dn1.10. This is then broken up into four segments, named dn1.10.1, dn1.10.2, etc. These same segment numbers apply to both text and translation. Here is how this looks in the underlying file, which uses the PO file type of the open source gettext translation system.",

These often occur because in the shorter discourses there are many abbreviations and repetitions, so it is not always clear exactly how the texts should be counted.",

In addition, references to Taishō texts are typically redundant, specifying both the volume/page and the sūtra number.

Further, the Taishō relies heavily on the <i>juan</i> or “folio” for structuring texts, which again is entirely a print-bound convention.",
