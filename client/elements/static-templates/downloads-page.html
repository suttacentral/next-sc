            <h2>Raw Data and Texts</h2>
            <p>All the raw SuttaCentral data (<code>json</code>, <code>html</code>, etc.) is
              <a href="https://github.com/suttacentral/" target="_blank">available on
                our GitHub repository</a>. </p>


            <h2>The Book of the Discipline</h2>

            <p>SuttaCentral is proud to offer the full text of <span class="author">I.B. Horner</span>’s translation of
              the Pali Vinaya in six volumes. This is the first time that this classic of 20th century Buddhist
              scholarship has been made available in a true digital edition. We are able to do this because the <a
                      href="http://www.palitext.com/" target="_blank">Pali Text Society</a>, holders of the copyright,
              kindly released the text under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" target="_blank">Creative
                Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0</a> licence.</p>

            <p>SuttaCentral exists to present the Buddhist texts, not people’s opinions about the texts, so our policy
              is to exclude introductions, footnotes, and the like. On SuttaCentral, therefore, we have only the
              translated text itself. However, in this case we felt that the scholarly apparatus was valuable enough to
              put the considerable effort into creating a proper digital edition of the entire text. This is what we
              offer in these downloads. These are, of course, covered by the same Creative Commons
              Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 licence. The text is presented in a number of formats, which are explained
              below.</p>

            <p>Further details on the process of creating these texts and on relevant changes are included in the
              Preface to the SuttaCentral edition. All versions include such enhancements as clickable links for over
              12,000 internal references, detailed tables of contents, and revised reference system.</p>

            <h2>Sutta Nipāta by Laurence Mills</h2>
            <p>The Sutta Nipāta is a well known and well loved early Buddhist text. It is a compilation of poems that
              inspire, educate, and admonish. Touching devotion, profound philosophy, pragmatic ethics, and insights
              into early Buddhist culture all find their place here. This translation expresses these teachings in a
              poetic voice. The primary translator and commentator is the experienced Pali scholar Laurence Khantipalo
              Mills, with portions by others including Bhikkhu Ñānamoli and Bhikkhu Sujato. Download the <a class="file"
