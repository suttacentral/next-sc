            <p>The Buddhist texts, whether in original languages or translation, are regarded by the Buddhist traditions as “the Buddha’s words”. They are a spiritual heritage of humanity, not belonging to any individual. At SuttaCentral we continue this tradition by making the texts available to everyone free of charge. Our work would not be possible if it were not for the freely given contributions of countless people, and we hope to repay this kindness in some small way by contributing our work for free.</p>
            <p>Our source files are freely available on <a href="https://github.com/suttacentral" title="SuttaCentral on Github" target="_blank">SuttaCentral’s Github repository</a>. SuttaCentral is proud to be part of the open source community.</p>
