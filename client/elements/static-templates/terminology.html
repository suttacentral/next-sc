            <h1>Basic Pali Terminology</h1>
            <p>This is a modified version of the <a href="https://www.accesstoinsight.org/glossary.html"
                                                    target="_blank">Glossary of Terms</a> from Access to Insight. We
              adapt this useful resource with gratitude. Changes include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Removing all later texts and references, retaining only references directly to the early texts.</li>
              <li>In quite a few cases, terminology and definitions have been changed, corrected, or deleted. However,
                most of the content is identical.
              </li>
              <li>HTML structure is modified.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In addition, note the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>References only include the Pali texts.</li>
              <li>The list is not meant to be complete, but merely offers a handy guide to some common terms in their
                most important meanings.

              <dd>Gradual instruction. The Buddha’s method of teaching Dhamma that guides his listeners progressively
                through increasingly advanced topics: generosity (see <a href="#dana"><i>dāna</i></a>), virtue (see <a

                      href="#kilesa"><i>kilesa</i></a>), who has abandoned all ten of the fetters that bind the mind to
                the cycle of rebirth (see <a href="#samyojana"><i>saṃyojana</i></a>), whose heart is free of mental
                defilements (see <a href="#asava"><i>āsava</i></a>), and who is thus not destined for further rebirth. A
                title for the Buddha and the highest level of his noble disciples.

              <dt id="ariyadhana">ariyadhana</dt>

                noble paths (see <a href="#magga"><i>magga</i></a>). Compare <a href="#puthujjana"><i>puthujjana</i></a>

              <dt id="ariya-sacca">ariya-sacca</dt>
              <dd>Noble Truth. The sense is that the truth itself is noble, and it “ennobles” the one who realizes it.
                There are four: stress, the origin of stress, the disbanding of stress, and the path of practice leading
                to the disbanding of stress.

              <dt id="asava">āsava</dt>
              <dd>Mental defilement, pollutant, or corruption. Four qualities—sensuality, views, desire for rebirth, and
                ignorance—that “flow out” of the mind and create the flood of the round of death and rebirth.
              </dd>
              <dt id="asubha">asubha</dt>
              <dd>Unattractiveness, loathsomeness, foulness. The Buddha recommends contemplation of this aspect of the
                body as an antidote to lust and complacency. See also <i><a href="#kayagata-sati">kāyagatā-sati</a></i>.

              <dd>Unawareness; ignorance; obscured awareness; not seeing the Four Noble Truths. See also <i><a

              <dd>Sense field. The inner sense fields are the sense organs: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind.
                The outer sense media are their respective stimuli.

              <dd>Venerable sir. In the Pali texts, this is used as a vocative in addressing the Buddha or a Buddhist
                monk. In modern usage it is often used also as a title.
              </dd>
              <dt id="bhava">bhava</dt>
              <dd>Existence, life, or rebirth. States of existence that develop first in the mind and can then be
                experienced as internal worlds and/or as worlds on an external level. There are three levels of
                existence: on the sensual level, the level of form, and the level of formlessness.
              </dd>
              <dt id="bhavana">bhāvanā</dt>
              <dd>Mental cultivation or development; meditation. The third of the three grounds for meritorious action.

              <dt id="bhikkhu">bhikkhu</dt>
              <dd>Mendicant; Buddhist monk; a man who has given up the householder’s life to live a life of heightened
                virtue (see <a href="#sila"><i>sīla</i></a>) in accordance with the <a href="#vinaya"><i>Vinaya</i></a>
                in general, and the <a href="#patimokkha"><i>Pātimokkha</i></a> rules in particular. The root of the
                word means “mendicant”, i.e. one who lives by alms. As the masculine is used as default gender in Pali,
                the term <i>bhikkhu</i> often includes nuns as well, so “mendicant” can be used as a gender-neutral
                translation. See <a href="#sangha"><i>saṅgha</i></a>, <a href="#parisa"><i>parisā</i></a>, <a

                    to maintain the good that has arisen;

                lives, while others practiced as renunciates. Nevertheless, they long maintained that by their birth,
                they are worthy of the highest respect. Buddhism borrowed the term brahman to apply to those who have
                attained the goal, to show that respect is earned not by birth, race, or caste, but by spiritual
                attainment. Used in the Buddhist sense, this term is synonymous with <i><a

              <dd>The name given to one who rediscovers for himself the liberating path of Dhamma, after a long period
                of its having been forgotten by the world. According to tradition, a long line of Buddhas stretches off
                into the distant past. The most recent Buddha was born Siddhattha Gotama in India around 500 BCE. A
                well-educated and wealthy young man, he relinquished his family and his princely inheritance in the
                prime of his life to search for true freedom and an end to suffering (<i><a
                        href="#dukkha">dukkha</a></i>). After seven years of austerities in the forest, he rediscovered
                the “middle way” and achieved his goal, becoming Buddha.

                (see <a href="#nivarana"><i>nīvaraṇa</i></a>) through the development of five mental factors: <a

                to be considered mainly malevolent, but in the Buddha’s day they were morally ambiguous, and in fact
                were commonly worshiped as deities.
