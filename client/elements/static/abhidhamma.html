       The Abhidhamma Piṭaka is the last of the three

              Buddhist schools. It takes the terms and ideas found in the Discourses, and organizes and analyzes them
              systematically.

       Unlike the Suttas and Vinaya, the Abhidhamma texts of the different schools are not closely related. It
              seems likely, in fact, that these were some of the formative texts in establishing the different schools.
              Nevertheless, Erich Frauwallner in his
       <cite inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('eba88109c0e1d6e098871d2ae1a08056')}}">
       </cite>
       (1996) has identified certain core features of Abhidhamma that are common
              between the traditions. This notably includes the Pali Vibhaṅga, the Sarvāstivāda Dharmaskandha, and the
              Dharmaguptaka Śāripūtrābhidharmaśastra. These texts all include a common core, which is ultimately derived
              from the Saṁyutta Nikāya.

       is comparable to the English “meta-” in the sense of “about the Dhamma,
              about the Vinaya”, and refers to discussions and conversations about the teachings. Such conversations
              would have, over time, been remembered and shared, and evolved gradually into the formalistic treatises of
              the Abhidhammapiṭaka.

       The traditions vary in how they see the origin of the Abhidhamma. The Chinese and Tibetan traditions
              typically ascribe each Abhidhamma book to a disciple of the Buddha. However, certain of the Vinaya
              accounts of the First Council include the Abhidhamma, and thus assume that it was present at the time of
              the Buddha’s passing. The Theravāda tradition also holds that the texts (with the exception of the
              Kathāvatthu) were spoken by the Buddha. This is mentioned in the late canononical Parivāra (
       <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('46a9dee577a42e0be52931d79970e225')}}">
       </i>
       , Pvr 3#5) and the paracanonical Milindapañha (
       <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('dc3dc8140411e1e84a794dc21d35c419')}}">
       </i>
       , Mil 2#55), which both date from about three to four hundred years after the Buddha
              passed away. The Theravādin commentaries were later to claim that the Buddha taught the seven books of the
              Abhidhamma Piṭaka to the deities in Tāvatiṁsa heaven, headed by his mother. Venerable Sāriputta
              subsequently learned them and conveyed them to his students.

       While they introduced a number of new terms and methods, the canonical Abhidhamma texts are doctrinally
              conservative. Many of the concepts familiar from later Abhidhamma are not found—ultimate vs. conventional
              truth, mind moments,
       <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('030a703db3a0b73fbd69f2b21ca9027a')}}">

       </i>
       or
              indvidual essence. While some new terms are found, for the most part they seem to have been introduced in
              order to clarify and disambiguate the terminology, and weren’t intended to convey specific new concepts.
              That is not to say that there are no new ideas, just that they play a fairly minor role overall.

       The Dhammasaṅgaṇī (Enumeration of Phenomena) is built on the idea of a

              Most of these are doctrinal terms familiar from the suttas, although some are specialized Abhidhamma

       The Puggalapaññatti (Designation of Persons) departs from the strictly phenomenological approach of most

              suggested by the numerical arrangement, these terms are mostly derived from the Aṅguttara Nikāya, with
              modest changes in wording. The main concern is to classify personal or psychological tendencies as they
              relate to the development of the Buddhist path.
