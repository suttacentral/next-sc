          <h2>A professional, full-time developer</h2>

          <p>The content on SuttaCentral has been made possible by volunteers. While their contribution is
            irreplaceable, we believe that these teachings are of such significance, and the work involved so great,
            that it is time for us to employ a full time developer. </p>

          <p>We are fortunate to have the services of Blake Walsh, one of the few people in the world who is qualified
            in the Buddhist texts and languages, and also in progamming. With your support, Blake will be able to work
            full time to make SuttaCentral even better.</p>

          <p>Our target is to raise $1000/week to continue to employ Blake, and support the other costs of
            SuttaCentral.</p>

          <h2>How can I help?</h2>

          <p>You can contact our volunteer financial manager, Deepika Weerakoon
            (suttacentraldevelopmenttrust@gmail.com). Deepika manages the funds on behalf of SuttaCentral Development
            Trust. Consider making a monthly donation, to help us pay the regular wages. </p>

          <p>For donors of over $100, or over $10/month, we would like to offer as a gift a printed copy of the
            Theragāthā, the “Verses of the Senior Monks”. This fascinating but little-known text from the Pali Canon has
            been freshly translated by Bhante Sujato for SuttaCentral. Send us a message with your address in it when
            you donate so we can post this to you.</p>
