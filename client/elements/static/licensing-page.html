            <p>The Buddhist texts, whether in original languages or translation, are regarded by the Buddhist traditions
              as “the Buddha’s words”. They are a spiritual heritage of humanity, not belonging to any individual. At
              SuttaCentral we continue this tradition by making the texts available to everyone free of charge.</p>
            <p>Our source files are freely available on 
                <a href="https://github.com/suttacentral" title="SuttaCentral on Github" target="_blank">SuttaCentral’s
              Github repository</a>. SuttaCentral is proud to be part of the open source community.</p>
