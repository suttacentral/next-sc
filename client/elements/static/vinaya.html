      The Vinaya Piṭaka, “The Basket of Monastic Law,” contains the rules that are binding on monastics and the
            regulations that apply to monastic communities. The Monastic Law is available in more recensions than any
            other part of the Tipiṭaka. There is a full version in Pali, and four complete versions extant in Chinese
            translation, all belonging to different schools of early Buddhism: Mahāsāṅghika, Dharmaguptaka, Mahīśāsaka,
            and Sarvāstivāda. The Chinese Tipiṭaka also preserves other Vinaya related texts, such as an independent
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('b13755c175b7c8ff46a269b0a62e792b')}}">
      </i>
      of the Kāśyapīya School and several more or less school-specific Vinaya texts. The Vinaya
            of the Mūlasarvāstivāda school exists in three versions: a complete text in Tibetan translation, a mostly
            complete version in Chinese, and substantial portions in Sanskrit. There are also several Vinaya texts, as
            well as a large number of fragments, in Sanskrit and other Indic languages, mostly of Mahāsāṅghika,
            Sarvāstivāda, and Mūlasarvāstivāda provenance.

      , here translated as “Monastic Law,” originally probably meant “training,” as can be
            seen from its usage in the Sutta Piṭaka, “the Basket of Discourses.” In this sense it complements the
            Dhamma, the doctrine or teaching, which provides the instructions on how the training is to be achieved. The
            compound

      </i>
      is a common one in the earliest literature and might be rendered as “theory
            and practice.” Gradually the meaning shifted to refer to the rules of conduct instead, thus referring to the
            training in a narrower sense. Although the former usage is more common in the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('e43f06c2069749893048db535f8af246')}}">
      </i>
      , it is this
            latter usage of
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('f7fa56dc5c81c2da4a5cd2d17d6752ed')}}">
      </i>
      which has become the dominant one and which has prevailed to the present day.

     <p>
      The Monastic Law developed over a period of several centuries after the Buddha’s passing away. Yet given
            the close agreement on some of the most fundamental aspects of the Vinaya across all surviving scriptures,
            it seems likely that the earliest parts originated in the lifetime of the Buddha. This includes the rules of
            conduct binding on all monastics, known as the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      , and several of the most important
            procedures that regulate the proper functioning of the monastic communities. It is only these parts of the
            Vinaya that are part of the Early Buddhist Texts in the strictest sense.
     </p>
     <p>
      Around this kernel the Vinaya gradually expanded. Over time, the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules gained a canonical
            commentary that included origin stories, word analyses, detailed permutation series on the applicability of
            the rules, non-offense clauses, and case studies. For the rest of the Vinaya, known as the Khandhakas, the
            expansion was less structured, with minor rules, stories, and procedures apparently being added as the need
            arose. It has been shown by Frauwallner (1956) that, despite a significant common core, many of the details
            of this part of the Vinaya vary between the schools.

       A complete Mahāsāṅghika Vinaya, found in the Chinese Tipiṭaka at T 1425, was translated into Chinese by
              Faxian and Buddhabhadra in 416-418 CE. Although its section of Khandhakas is structured differently from
              that of the other schools, the content appears to largely overlap. Further study is required to clarify
              the degree of divergence. Substantial parts of this Vinaya has also been preserved in Buddhist Hybrid
              Sanskrit, including the Mahāvastu, a large work mostly concerned with the biography of the Buddha, as well
              as the Suttavibhaṅga for the nuns and the monks’

      </i>
      rules as a complete set.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Suttavibhaṅga consists of the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules embedded in a commentary that analyses each rule
            in detail. The Suttavibhaṅga is divided into two parts, the 227 rules for the monks and the 311 rules for
            the nuns. The majority of rules are the same for the two Orders, but 130 rules are specific to the nuns and
            46 specific to the monks. The greater number of rules for the nuns is in large part due to the subdivision
            of individual monks’ rules into multiple rules for the nuns and to the fact that the nuns have rules in
            their
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      that the monks have in the Khandhakas.

     </p>
     <p>
      Within the Suttavibhaṅga, each rule is largely self-contained and forms its own subsection. These sections
            begin with one or more origin stories that relate the incident that led the Buddha to lay down a particular
            rule. Many of these are no more than brief accounts of a stereotypical monk or nun who is simply stated to
            have done something inappropriate. A few are elaborate narratives that may include sub-rules or important
            procedures for the monastic Order, and occasionally even
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('6bdf6b931b7dff3f6e388b2684f87d3b')}}">
      </i>
      -type material or Jātaka-type stories.
            The majority of origin stories fall somewhere in between these two extremes.

     <p>
      Next comes a non-offense clause, which sets out important exemptions for each rule. The non-offense clause
            is sometimes followed by a set of case studies. These concern specific instances where a monastic acts in
            such a way that it is not clear-cut whether they have committed an offense. The incident is related and the
            Buddha then decides on the matter. This section is similar in content to the origin stories. Only the first
            nine rules of the monks’
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">

      </i>
      makes it clear that these texts in large part go back
            to the pre-sectarian period of Buddhism (Pachow, 2000). As for the rest of the material in the
            Suttavibhaṅga, academics normally consider this material to be significantly younger than the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules (v. Hinüber, 2000: 13f), but it is nevertheless likely that some of it goes back to
            the earliest period (Pachow, 2000: 14ff). In the absence of more detailed research, it seems prudent to
            regard the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      as the only part of the Suttavibhaṅga that belongs to the Early Buddhist Texts.
     </p>
     <p>
      But even this overstates the case, for it is clear that not even all the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules belong to
            the earliest period (Pachow, 2000). This is true of many, perhaps all, of the most minor rules of the monks’
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      , the

      </i>
      , but especially of the rules for the nuns, many of which vary
            considerably between the different schools, making it likely that they stem from the sectarian period.

      The Khandhakas lack the close unifying principle found in the Suttavibhaṅga, which, as we have seen, is
            organised as a commentary and analysis of the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules. This makes the Khandhakas less
            integrated and more diverse than the Suttavibhaṅga.

     <p>
      The “biography” of the Buddha is in fact largely considered part of the Vinaya in all Buddhist schools.
            (Some schools even include their version of the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta in the Vinaya, rather than among the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('e43f06c2069749893048db535f8af246')}}">
      </i>
      , as with the Theravādins.) The Khandhakas show ordinary interactions of the Buddha with
            monastics and lay people, and we get a glimpse of the Buddha as real person, not just as the distant teacher
            and leader of a large religious organisation. We see him walking around the Ganges plain, meeting a variety
            of people. We see him in close contact with his monastic disciples, criticising their misdeeds, but also
            praising them when they get it right. The touching story of the Buddha and Ven. Ānanda cleaning up a monk
            suffering from dysentery is found in the Khandhakas. This close and almost personal view of the Buddha is
            one factor that makes the Khandhakas a particularly interesting collection.
     </p>
     <p>
      One of the main functions of the Khandhakas is to present the procedures by which the monastic Orders
            conduct their business. These include the ordination procedure and the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('7f978f3317754dae80b8716c43afa053')}}">
      </i>
      ceremony, but also a
            number of other procedures that enable the Orders to function properly. These procedures are governed by
            precise rules, especially regarding democratic participation and decentralised decision making. They allow
            for effective and harmonious dispatch of monastic business.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Khandhakas include a large number of minor rules not found in the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      . These rules are
            diverse, but can broadly be summarised as prohibiting luxuries and sensual behaviour, both of which are
            incompatible with the renunciant life.

      The Khandhakas end with a description of the first

      </i>
      , the first “communal recitation” of the
            teachings after the Buddha’s passing away, as well as the famous Vesālī affair, sometimes known as the
            Second Council, where the Order with difficulty resolved a disagreement over issues of Vinaya. The Vesālī
            affair is said to have happened around one hundred years after the Buddha passed away. It is around this
            time that sectarian tendencies are starting to form in the monastic Order, and this is roughly the
            cut-of-point for the common heritage of all Buddhists.

      In practice, it is rare for monastics to follow all the stipulations of their chosen Vinaya lineage. For
            instance, although the use of money is prohibited by the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules of all schools, it is
            nevertheless used by the vast majority of monastics. The extent to which the rules are followed varies
            enormously, but most monastic do at least follow the most important rules, that is, the rules entailing
            expulsion and those entailing suspension. A similar situation holds for the procedures that govern the
            Orders. Sometimes they are practiced to the letter, such as most ordination ceremonies in the Theravāda
            tradition. At other times the procedures are misinterpreted or simply disregarded, such as the procedures
            for choosing the officials of the Order.
     </p>
     <p>
      Over the course of Buddhist history, there have been periodic reform movements and irregular attempts at
            purifying the monastic Order. Typically the Order gradually degenerates until a charismatic leader starts a
            reform movement aimed at the proper practice of the Buddhist path, including the Vinaya. These reform
            movement sometimes manifest as “forest traditions,” whereby monastics establish forest monasteries in
            conformity with the ideals of early Buddhism. Over the last three decades, one controversial and ongoing
            reform has been the reestablishment of an Order of nuns,

      The commentarial literature begins with the Suttavibhaṅga, which, although it is now part of the Canon, is
            an early commentary on the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('ed23ac5cfbf6ad22201466966eb052ad')}}">
      </i>
      rules. Next we have other Canonical commentaries or summaries,
            such as the Parivāra of the Theravādins. Beyond these, we come to the commentaries proper, the

      </i>
      ,
            “The Discussion on Meaning.”
     </p>
     <p>
      The most important non-canonical commentary on the Theravādin Vinaya Piṭaka is the Samantapāsādikā,
            composed in Sri Lanka by Buddhaghosa in the fifth century CE based on pre-existing commentaries that
            probably originated in India. There is also another important commentary from this period, the
            Kaṅkhāvitaraṇī, also composed by Buddhaghosa. The next layer of commentaries are the

      , the
            sub-commentaries, of which there are over a dozen, including highly specialised literature, such as
            handbooks on monastery boundaries (

      continue to be composed to the present day.
            The extent to which the Canonical Vinaya needs to be interpreted in line with this commentarial tradition is
            typically controversial, and practices vary widely.

      In addition to the above, most Theravāda monasteries follow a number of rules that are more informal in
            nature. These include rules used to distinguish individual sects (
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('52cb435c01c3dfdfacad4034fdc10639')}}">
      </i>
      ), such as rules on the
            style of robes and on the manner of wearing them. Then there are rules that pertain to particular teacher
            traditions, such as those that often form around especially charismatic and famous teachers. The final set
            of rules are those laid down at individual monasteries. These regulate the daily schedule and other aspects
            of monastic life that are monastery specific. Although all these rules are sometimes called Vinaya and
            therefore assumed to stem from the Vinaya Piṭaka or at least the commentaries, in reality few of them have
            any Canonical basis.
