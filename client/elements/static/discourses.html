            texts in other languages. Not all of these texts stem from the very earliest period, but we aim to be
            inclusive, so as to not miss any of the early scriptures. Generally speaking, they represent the first few
            centuries of Buddhist texts, with a special emphasis on those that may be plausibly attributed to the
            historical Buddha and his immediate disciples. Later texts such as the Mahāyāna sūtras fall outside our

      There are several different accounts of the First Council, and they vary somewhat in the details of the

            of the Vinaya. These are sometimes referred to as the Early Buddhist Texts (EBTs). It’s not the case that
            everything recited at the Council was identical with what we have today. Even the traditions acknowledge
            that there were additions. However, it seems reasonable to accept that the bulk of the content of these
            texts stems from this time. The main changes were in structure and arrangement, while changes to content
            were limited and readily identifiable.

       More precisely known as the Mahāvihāravāsins, the “Dwellers in the Great
              Monastery (at Anurādhapura)”, this group was established in Sri Lanka by Aśoka’s son, Mahinda. They passed
              down the collection known as the Pali Tipiṭaka, or Pali Canon. The collection retains the characteristics
              of its mainland origin, possibly from Avanti, and few changes were made on the island. This school
              exclusively used Pali for its canonical texts.

       This was an influential school, or group of schools, mostly based in the
              north-west of India. We possess an extensive range of their Discourses—a Majjhima, a Saṁyutta, most of a
              Dīgha, and several partial collections. The bulk of the extant sutta texts in Sanskrit, Chinese, and
              Tibetan hail from this school, or one of their branches such as the Mūlasarvāstivāda. Their distinctive
              doctrine was that all phenomena in some sense “exist” in the past, present, and future. However, like all
              sectarian doctrines, this made little to no impact on their canonical texts. Their texts were passed down
              mainly in Sanskrit, and sometimes in a sanskritized Prākrit.

      In the Buddha’s forty-five years of teaching, he was mainly concerned to address the person or people he
            was with, to appease their suffering. Thus he was not concerned with creating a overarching canon of his
            teachings. However, he did give some indications of a broader system of classifying the teachings. Sometimes
            he mentioned certain doctrinal formulations as the central content of his teachings—the four noble truths,
            or the sets of teachings on practice that came to be known as the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('02bd50338349b022a27741b3faa6f6ad')}}">
      </i>
      , the “things
            leading to awakening”. These sets of doctrines form the backbone of the Saṁyutta Nikāya. He also mentioned
            an organization by literary style, known as the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('7227865c3809cdf6ccf8b43a6ebc73c3')}}">
      </i>
      or “branches”. While the Pali texts mention
            nine
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('7227865c3809cdf6ccf8b43a6ebc73c3')}}">

      , the northern texts typically mention twelve, and there is some indication that originally
            there may have been only three or four.
     </p>
     <p>
      Regardless of how the texts were organized in the Buddha’s life, early on the schools reorganized the texts
            in the system of
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('52cb435c01c3dfdfacad4034fdc10639')}}">

            “collection” or “group”, is preferred in the Theravādin context, while the northern tradition usually used

      </i>
      , which has the sense of a “tradition” or “transmission”; however, these usages are not specific
            and may be used in any tradition.) This reorganization may well have started from the First Council, or at
            any rate, not much later. The primary motive was to arrange the collection into more manageable sections in
            order to facilitate memorization. The
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('52cb435c01c3dfdfacad4034fdc10639')}}">

      </i>
      . The sequence of these is not fixed. The
            form adopted on SuttaCentral is the well-known sequence as used in the Pali tradition. In other schools, as
            implied by the accounts of the First Council, the collections were in different orders, such as placing the
            Saṁyutta first. Note that in the Chinese canon, the editors of the Taishō edition rearranged their material
            under the influence of the Pali canon to adopt the same sequence.

      includes material that was edited and arranged, and sometimes added to, over a
            period of time. While each collection contains some unique texts, for the most part the differences in the

            different collections.

              ambitions than the remaining texts, and one of its aims seems to have been the conversion of brahmins, an
              educated class used to sophisticated literature. The Pali Dīgha Nikāya (DN) has 34 discourses, the Chinese
              (Dharmagupta) Dīrghāgama (DA) has 30. An old Sanskrit manuscript of the Sarvāstivādins, largely
              unpublished, indicates that their collection contained 47 discourses. In addition, there are a number of

              four noble truths, and the eightfold noble path. We have the Saṁyutta Nikāya (SN) in Pali, and a
              comparable Saṁyuktāgama of the Sarvāstivādins in Chinese translation (SA). In Chinese we also find two

       The “numbered” or “numerical” discourses are usually known as Aṅguttara

              this is the form usually found in the northern collections. These collections organize texts in numbered

              community. The Ekottarikāgama (EA) in Chinese is a highly unusual text, which features a range of
              variations within itself when it comes even to basic doctrines. It shares considerably less in common with
              the Pali Aṅguttara than the other collections do with their counterparts. In addition, there is a partial

      This general picture, however, gets more complicated when we try to pin down the details. While the
            Discourses are largely similar in each canon, they are not identical. Each of the three main schools
            maintains its own distinct canons: the Theravāda of South and Southeast Asia have their texts in Pali;
            Buddhists of Central Asia use Tibetan; and in East Asia the canon is in Chinese. A full set of

      are in Pali; extensive collections are found in Chinese; and limited selections are found in
            Tibetan. The Sanskrit and other early Indic texts are not part of any formal canon, but the texts are
            nevertheless canonical in the sense that they are recognized as being the same as the texts in the canon.

            magic formulas and the like. While Buddhists are generally aware that there is such a thing as the Tipiṭaka
            that contains the words of the Buddha, only educated Buddhists have a clear idea of the contents. There is
            no tradition in Buddhism comparable to the Bible readings of the Christian Mass, and so no standard way of
            communicating the contents of the texts directly to the people.

      In East Asian Buddhism, traditional education focused on the Mahāyāna sutras and the texts of the Chinese
            masters, and there is little evidence that the early discourses were widely studied. It is sometimes said
            that the translation style of the
      <i inner-h-t-m-l="{{localize('189eb057c34a1b6787912f6b1017aec9')}}">
      </i>
      compares poorly with the more elegant diction of the
            Mahāyāna translations by Xuanzang and other masters. And the early discourses are, of course, not organized
            for easy reading and study.

      Tibetan Buddhism includes study of early Buddhist schools as part of its regular curriculum. However, this
            refers to the Abhidhamma doctrines of the later schools. A reasonable grasp of the early Buddhist texts is,
            nevertheless, possible to achieve in Tibetan. Even though full

      texts are lacking, substantial
            passages from the early texts are found in the Upāyika, which is a compilation of passages referred to in
            the Abhidharmakoṣa, and in other scattered texts.

       Modern approaches to meditation were developed based on Pali texts. The Burmese

       schools
              took the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta as their core text, making this the single most influential text in the modern
              practice of meditation. In Thailand, reform movements such as the Forest Tradition, or Ajahn Buddhadāsa’s
              explicitly sutta-based approach, rejected traditional contemplative practices based on magical
              invocations, and advocated a return to the body-focused and grounded mindfulness practices of the early
              suttas.

       The hugely influential Taishō edition of the Chinese canon was developed by Japanese scholars who had
              studied text-critical techniques in Germany. They rearranged the canon to put the

              of place at the start of the collection, in the sequence found in the Pali. They also included limited
              information on Pali parallels.
